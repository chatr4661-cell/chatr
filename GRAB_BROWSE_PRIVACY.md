## Data Processing

### Camera & Hand Detection
**What we process:**
- Camera video frames for hand landmark detection
- Hand gesture coordinates (21 3D points per frame)

**Where it's processed:**
- ✅ **100% on your device** using MediaPipe WebAssembly
- ❌ **Never uploaded** to servers or cloud

**What we store:**
- ✅ Nothing. Frames are processed in memory and immediately discarded
- ❌ No video recordings, no hand biometrics

**Your control:**
- Camera access requires explicit permission
- Disable gesture mode anytime
- Clear browser permissions to revoke access

---

### Screenshot Capture
**What we capture:**
- Screen content at the moment of gesture completion
- Stored temporarily in browser memory as image blob

**Where it's stored:**
- ✅ **On your device** until you initiate transfer or cancel
- ❌ **Never auto-uploaded** to servers

**Your control:**
- You choose when to capture (gesture required)
- You choose whether to share or delete
- Captured images cleared on page refresh

---

### File Transfer
**What we transfer:**
- Files you explicitly choose to send
- Encrypted file chunks via WebRTC DataChannel

**Encryption:**
- ✅ **End-to-end encrypted** with AES-GCM-256
- ✅ **Ephemeral keys** generated per transfer (ECDH P-256)
- ✅ **Perfect forward secrecy** - keys destroyed after transfer

**Server involvement:**
- ✅ Only for WebRTC signaling (connection setup)
- ✅ Signaling messages auto-deleted after 5 minutes
- ❌ **No file data** passes through our servers (P2P transfer)

**Your control:**
- Explicit action required to initiate transfer
- Cancel transfer anytime
- No transfer history stored

---

### AI Search & Browser
**What we collect:**
- Search queries you type
- Clicked search results (for recommendations)

**What we send to AI:**
- Your query + top 5 search results (titles, snippets, URLs)
- No personal identifying information

**Data retention:**
- ✅ Search results cached locally for 24 hours
- ✅ AI summaries cached to reduce API calls
- ❌ No long-term query history stored

**Third-party data sharing:**
- Search queries sent to: Bing Web Search API, Google Programmable Search (as configured)
- AI summaries generated by: Lovable AI Gateway (powered by GPT-4)
- Subject to those services' privacy policies

**Your control:**
- Clear browser cache to delete cached results
- Use incognito mode for private searches

---

## Analytics (Privacy-First)

We collect **anonymous usage metrics** to improve the feature:

**What we track:**
- ✅ Gesture success rate (% captures completed)
- ✅ Transfer completion rate
- ✅ Average search latency
- ❌ **No personally identifiable information**
- ❌ **No IP addresses, device IDs, or user IDs**

**Metrics are aggregated** and cannot be linked to individual users.

## Your Privacy Rights

### Access & Deletion
- All data processed locally - nothing to access/delete from servers
- Clear browser cache/storage to remove cached data
- Revoke camera permissions in browser settings

### Data Portability

### Opt-Out
- Disable gesture mode: Don't activate the feature
- Disable AI browser: Use standard web search instead
- Disable analytics: Use browser's Do Not Track setting

## Security Measures

1. **On-device processing**: Hand detection runs locally via WebAssembly
2. **End-to-end encryption**: File transfers use AES-GCM + ECDH
3. **Ephemeral keys**: Transfer keys destroyed after use
4. **No server storage**: Files never stored on our servers
5. **Auto-cleanup**: Signaling data deleted after 5 minutes
6. **TLS 1.3**: All network communication encrypted in transit
7. **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS and code injection
