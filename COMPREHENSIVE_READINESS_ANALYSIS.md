## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. **Authentication & Onboarding Flow**

#### Missing Signup Form

## 📊 CONCLUSION

**Production Readiness: 60-65%**

**Working Well:**
- Core authentication (phone, Google)
- Basic one-on-one messaging
- Voice/video calling infrastructure
- Database schema and security

**Critical Blockers:**
- No email/password signup
- Group chat UI missing
- File/voice attachments broken
- Many features have backend but no UI

**Recommendation:**
**NOT ready for production launch.** Requires 3-4 weeks of focused development to complete missing features and integrate existing components. The foundation is solid, but user-facing functionality is incomplete.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete authentication options
2. Finish messaging features (group, attachments, reactions)
3. Test all health and appointment flows
4. Integrate social features properly
5. Conduct full security audit
6. Perform end-to-end user testing
