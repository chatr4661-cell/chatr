## 🔐 Security Implementation

### **Row-Level Security (RLS)**

All tables have RLS enabled with team-based access control:

```sql
-- Example: crm_leads policies
CREATE POLICY "Team members can view business leads"
ON crm_leads FOR SELECT
USING (
  business_id IN (
    SELECT business_id FROM business_team_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

**Access Control**:
- ✅ Team members can view/manage leads for their business only
- ✅ No cross-business data leakage
- ✅ All operations validated through business_team_members table

### **Input Validation (Zod)**

**File**: `src/lib/validations/crm.ts`

```typescript
export const leadSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string()
    .trim()
    .min(1, 'Name is required')
    .max(100)
    .regex(/^[a-zA-Z\s'-]+$/, 'Only letters, spaces, hyphens'),
  
  email: z.string().trim().email().max(255).optional(),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^[\d\s\-\+\(\)]+$/).min(10).max(20).optional(),
  // ... more validations
});
```

**Validation Rules**:
- ✅ Client-side validation with detailed error messages
- ✅ Length limits on all text fields
- ✅ Regex patterns for phone/email
- ✅ No SQL injection risk
- ✅ Type safety with TypeScript
