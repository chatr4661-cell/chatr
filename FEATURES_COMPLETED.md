## 🔒 Security & Performance

### File Upload Security
- ✅ Client-side file size validation (10MB max)

- ✅ Public bucket (files accessible via URL, appropriate for messaging)
- ✅ File type filtering on client (no executable files)

### Voice Recording Security
- ✅ Requires explicit microphone permission
- ✅ Audio transcribed server-side (no client-side API keys)
- ✅ Audio files stored same as other media

### Broadcast Security
