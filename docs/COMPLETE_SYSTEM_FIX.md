## What to Test

1. Make a voice call between two browsers
2. Make a video call between two browsers
3. Let a call timeout (don't answer for 60 seconds)
4. Deny camera permission and see error message
5. Refresh index page multiple times - should load fast
6. Check console - contact sync should happen in background

All core issues are now resolved. The calling system is fully functional with proper error handling, timeouts, and user feedback.
