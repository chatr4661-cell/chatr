## The 7 Pillars Explained

| Pillar | Purpose | Key Differentiator |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 🧠 SI-First Communication | Intelligence layer | Real-time translation, smart replies |
| 🔐 Privacy by Default | Security foundation | E2E encryption on by default (unlike Telegram) |
| 🌍 Universal Access | Platform reach | Web + Native parity, offline-first |
| 📡 Carrier Independence | Network freedom | No SIM, multi-device, global free |
| 🛡️ Carrier-Grade Reliability | System trust | State machine, handoff, OEM survival |
| 🚨 Safety & Emergency | Critical fallback | GSM 911/112, missed call recovery |
| 🆔 Identity & Trust | User security | Device-bound, collision protection |

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ USE FOR:
- Website "Why CHATR" section
- Investor deck (early slides)
