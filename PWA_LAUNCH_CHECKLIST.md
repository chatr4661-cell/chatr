**Example implementation**:
```typescript
// In /install page
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  // Track that prompt was shown
  analytics.track('pwa_install_prompt_shown');
});

// When user clicks install
button.onClick = () => {
  analytics.track('pwa_install_clicked');
  deferredPrompt.prompt();
};
```

### Monitor Usage

**Metrics to track**:
- Install conversion rate
- Daily active users (PWA vs browser)
- Offline usage percentage
